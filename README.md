# Hotel Menu Website

A simple, responsive hotel menu website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project displays a menu with filterable categories (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts) and a clean, modern design.

## Features
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to desktop and mobile screens using CSS Grid and media queries.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Filter menu items by category with JavaScript.
- **Modern Design**: Clean typography, subtle animations, and a cohesive color scheme.
- **Easy Customization**: Add or modify menu items in the HTML.

## Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, custom properties, and transitions for styling.
- **JavaScript**: Event handling for dynamic filtering.

## Setup
1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone: `git clone https://github.com/MosesEsquire/hotel_menu.git`
   - Or download the ZIP file.
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd hotel_menu

### **How It Works**
- **HTML**: Defines the menu structure with categories and items, using `data-category` attributes for filtering.
- **CSS**: 
  - Uses a grid layout for menu items that adjusts based on screen size.
  - Includes hover effects and a responsive filter navigation that stacks on mobile.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Listens for clicks on filter buttons.
  - Shows/hides menu items based on the selected category and updates the active button state.
